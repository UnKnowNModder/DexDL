### üí¢ Important Note:
- this currently supports english translated manga only, so any language other than this will result in an empty pdf of the specific chapter.
- it won't be able to download manga that are uploaded by other sources on mangadex.org, like (self-uploaded) and certain sources available on mangadex uploads.
